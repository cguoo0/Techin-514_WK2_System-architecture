This device is designed for individuals with visual impairments, such as blind people or older individuals with eye issues. It can be attached to a cane, wheelchair, or use as a watch. The device emits a sound when it detects possible obstacles like barricades, footsteps, curbs, or holes. It utilizes a lidar sensor to measure the distance and size of the obstacle, and then use gauge stepper motor to display how far the obstacles are. Once the walker is approaching the obstacles, the screen will remind walker to change direction, and LED and buzzer will emit signal to users.
